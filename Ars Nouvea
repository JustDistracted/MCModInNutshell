Problem : mid-game op

Why I want this mod
1. Super Cool Tree
2. Some of cool mechanics - ritual, enchanting using ingredients, Automation via cute familiars

Why not?
1. spellbook is too strong. ultimate multitool : I want traditional tool function only belongs to tetra. 
2. Overlap with create mod.


Changes
1.Wilden spawns naturally in archwood forest. 
2.Some glyph tier moves to upper tier. spell book and turret will become more focused on utility.
