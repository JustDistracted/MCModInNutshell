# MCModInNutshell
Just a brief descriptions about too much minecraft mod

1. This is for just personal use, for modpack generation.  
2. My main version is 1.19.2 Forge(43.3.7), but I also handle 1.20.1 mods. All description is suited for those version. There will be no Fabric, Quilt, or Neoforge mods that cannot be used in Forge 1.20.1 or 1.19.2. There also will be no mod that do not work in those versions.
3. I could be wrong because this list is WIP. If there is wrong information, please submit issue then I will change Quick

I made this one for
1. To know which mod adds which things (Biomes, Dimensions, Mobs, Mechanics, Items, Blocks...)
2. To classify mods into smaller things (Curseforge or Modrinth have some guideline)
3. To write down overlapped features list for modpack development.

Optimization and Utility mods have far much better list so I will not focus on them.
